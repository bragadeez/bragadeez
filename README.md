## About Me

I'm an ML Engineer passionate about designing **practical, scalable, real-time AI systems**.  
My expertise spans:

- Deep Learning (CNNs, Transformers, LLMs, RAG)  
- Computer Vision - YOLO, classification, real-time detection  
- NLP - LLM apps, OCR pipelines, retrieval systems  
- MLOps - containers, benchmarking, optimization, automation  
- Deployment - real-world systems on cloud, edge devices, and web

I enjoy solving applied AI problems, building production-ready pipelines, and making models interpretable using XAI.
